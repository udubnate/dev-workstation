# Quick and Dirty Dev Workstations in Azure (customized for me)

It's quick and dirty by design. Lots of flexibility, and not a lot of dependencies :) 

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fudubnate%2Fdev-workstation%2Fmaster%2Fazuredeploy.json)

Post-Deployment Config Script: [bit.ly/nate-dev](https://bit.ly/nate-dev)

from an Administrative PowerShell console
``` powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force; 

pre-req script : Install-PackageProvider -Name NuGet -MinimumVersion 2.8.5.201 -Force; Install-Module InvokeBuild -Force; Import-Module InvokeBuild
Invoke-Build -File C:\Initialize-DevWorkstation.ps1

iex '$((iwr bit.ly/nate-dev -usebasicparsing).Content)' | out-file c:\Initialize.ps1; c:\initialize.ps1 -UACNoConsent 
```

## Behind the Scenes

- How to create an Azure Button - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-to-azure-button
- Custom Variables - you can use different offers and customize the name of the VM, etc to meet your needs. Defaults to what I like.
